Here is the standardized Master Copy to use across all your mockups.
The Hero Copy Set
1. The Headline (H1)
This needs to be short enough to look good centered or left-aligned, but punchy enough to explain the value.
Text: Turn messy chat into perfect execution.
Bold: "perfect execution."
Accent Color (Pumpkin Orange): Apply to "perfect execution."
Why: This highlights the "After" state. The user wants to move from "Messy" (White/Black text) to "Perfect" (Brand Color).
2. The Subheadline (H2)
This explains what Pumpkin actually is.
Text: Pumpkin is the AI Chief of Staff for Logistics. We intercept vague instructions in Microsoft Teams, force clarity before they reach your staff, and stop the guesswork cycle forever.
Bold: "AI Chief of Staff" and "force clarity."
Italic: "before" (to emphasize the proactive nature of the bot).
Accent Color: None. Keep this readable (Grey/White).
3. Primary Call to Action (Button 1)
The main conversion goal.
Text: Add to Teams
Style: Solid Background (Pumpkin Orange).
Text Color: White or Dark Navy (depending on contrast).
Icon: Use the Microsoft Teams logo or a generic "Plus" icon (+).
4. Secondary Call to Action (Button 2)
The "low risk" option.
Text: See how it works
Style: Ghost button (Transparent background with a thin border).
Text Color: Same as your body text.
Icon: A "Play" triangle (▶).
5. Trust / Social Proof (Micro-copy)
Place this under the buttons or above the headline in small caps.
Text: TRUSTED BY MODERN OPS TEAMS
Style: Small caps, widely spaced (tracking), low opacity (50%).
